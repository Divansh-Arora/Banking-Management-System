# 🏦 Banking Management System (DAA Project)

A **console-based Banking Management System** implemented in **Python**, showcasing various **Data Structures and Algorithms (DAA)** concepts such as:
- Linear Search  
- Bubble Sort  
- Greedy Algorithm (Loan Allocation)  
- Dynamic Programming (Profit Maximization)  

This project simulates a simplified banking environment where users can manage accounts, handle transactions, and perform algorithm-based financial analyses.

## ⚙️ Features

✅ **Account Management**
- Add new accounts with details (Account No, Name, Balance, CIBIL Score)
- View all existing accounts
- Search accounts using **Linear Search**
- Sort accounts using **Bubble Sort** (by Balance or CIBIL Score)

✅ **Transaction Handling**
- Deposit and withdraw money
- Maintain a transaction log
- Sort transactions by amount using **Bubble Sort**

✅ **Loan Allocation (Greedy Algorithm)**
- Allocate loans based on highest CIBIL scores using a **max-heap**
- Simulates fund distribution efficiently and fairly

✅ **Profit Maximization (Dynamic Programming)**
- Calculate **maximum profit** from selected loans using a **0/1 Knapsack** approach

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

| Section | Algorithm | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| Account Search | **Linear Search** | Searches for an account by account number |
| Account Sorting | **Bubble Sort** | Sorts accounts by balance or CIBIL score (Descending) |
| Loan Allocation | **Greedy + Max-Heap** | Allocates loans based on highest CIBIL scores |
| Profit Calculation | **Dynamic Programming (Knapsack)** | Finds maximum profit from given loans & profits |

---

## 🧩 Data Structures Used

- **List**: For storing accounts and transactions  
- **Dictionary**: For structured account and transaction data  
- **Heap (Priority Queue)**: For greedy loan allocation  
- **1D DP Array**: For profit calculation (Dynamic Programming)
